        For example, if your dad gives you money and cares for you, and then he calls you for help ‚Äî would you ignore him? Most people wouldn‚Äôt. Now imagine the Creator, Allah, calls you just 5 times a day. It takes only 25 minutes of your time.
      </li>
      <li class="call">
        We all have problems in life. You may feel ignored by others, but Allah listens to everything. He is always there for you ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre sad or depressed.

        You can defeat laziness by making prayer a priority. For example, make it the first thing you do when you get home. Don‚Äôt rest ‚Äî do wuduu and pray right away.

        From the beginning of creation, Iblis (Satan) refused to obey Allah. So when you refuse to pray, think ‚Äî are you following his path? You can overcome him by simply being determined and consistent.
